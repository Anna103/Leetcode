    "boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and \n",
    "alternating direction each row.\n",
    "For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).\n",

    "\n",
    "You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.\n",
    "(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, \n",
    "regardless of the size of the board.)\n",
    "If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.\n",

    "At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].\n",

    "You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.\n",
    "You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.\n",
    "You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.\n",
